        <h3>Spiderman No way home</h3>
            <p>It is safe to say I am big superhero fan, and even more of a fan of spiderman.
                Although I don't think I give enough justice to the other movies from the trilogy,
                I do think this last installment from the Tom Holland third Spiderman movie is a great example of a great
                superhero story. What I mean by that, is that through out the whole trilogy we see our friendly neighbourhood
                Spiderman and Peter Parker himself grows as a charactor and person. We see his growth to become his own
                independed superhero and in the end of the third installment of the trillogy we see him branching
                off from the super Tony Stark hightech Spiderman into the humble hero we all 
                know and grown to love-the spiderman we know from the comic books and the one we have grown since the original
                trilogy starring Toby Maguire. But what I especially love about the story is the ultimate sacrifice.
                We pretty much gives up eveything he has and loves, save the world and most importantly to save the ones he 
                cares about. We truly see this Spiderboy to become and Spiderman.
                In the end Spiderman chose the mask and the responsobility he had with his power.
                "Liberated from juggling two lives. Peter Parker was no more. But Spiderman lives on."

        <h3>Spiderman Into the spiderverse</h3>
            <p>
                What can I say. I am a sucker for Spiderman. Another movie for our hero Spidey, but this time its animated 
                and the main hero of our story is not Peter Parker, but Miles Morales. And we also see his development and growth 
                to become from a normal highschool student to a superhero. What I love about this story is that emphises on how to
                become a hero or as Miles say it in the movie "How am I suppose to save the whole world?". In which his mentor, who is
                none other than Peter Parker himself, says : "You can't think about saving the world. You need to think about saving 
                one person." <br />
                Another great exchange I think is when Miles ask: "When do I know I am spiderman?". <br />
                To which Peter replies: "You won't. That's what it is Miles. A Leap of Faith." <br />
                To me I love the inspiring conversation between our characters, in a way that teaches us that sometimes in the path
                of whatever we choose to do, can be difficult and scary in the whole grand scheme and picture and is important to realise
                why are we doing it and for whome. Also I love the emphisize that sometimes when we do or want to do something, we
                don't always know if we are ready. But we just need the courage to do it. A little push. Faith in our abilities. <br />
                And in the end when Miles Morales as new established Spiderman is soaring throught the skies of his city, he says 
                essentially to the audiance: "Everyone can wear the mask. You can wear the mask! And if you didn't know that before,
                I hope you do now.". Which to mean implies that everyone can be a hero.

        <h3>Joker</h3>
            <p>Other than a good superhero movie I love a great supervillain story. This movie is anything but inspiring, but
                it shows the descent of man, who is sick and abondend from the world, turns into a madmen. What I love about the
                story is that through out the whole movie we get to see all the things that traumatize and hurts our main character 
                of the movie, to which point he tried to find condsilidation in the people around him and in his own mind. But allas
                to no avail, since his own imagination plays a cruel joke in fictiating what it seems a good life just something 
                in his head and the only person-his mom, who loves and trust, has been unloving and betraying him this whole time.
                He search for help for his mental problems, but is brushed of easily and never gets the help he needs and to top
                it all of he is being bullied by the higher ups in hierarchy. In the end, everything was just a formula for a conversation
                of the clown prince himself. Society has abandoned the sick man's call for help. So he came back with revenge. 
                And his voice was heard by everyone.
